# Weather Challenge

## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis is to use APIs in order to create maps with cities that fit a certain weather criteria, locate hotels nearby, and create driving itinerary between a few of those cities.
  
### Methodology
 1. The first order of business was to create a random list of cities using a random number generator for latitude and longitude and locating the nearest city using citypy.
 2. The next step was to refine this list based on temperature preferences using a max and min for temperature
 3. The next step was to locate the closest hotel to the cities in our list using google maps api and plot these on a map.
 4. Finally, I picked 4 cities in France and created an itinerary for driving between the cities.
